# Website: Fachpraktikum „Build your Online Portfolio“

## Home

### What will I do in this workshop?

In this workshop, you will create your own online portfolio from scratch in the form of a modern, responsive and fast website.

### What will I learn?

You will gather a basic understanding and knowledge of modern web technologies, such as HTML and CSS, the core of every website. To add content to your portfolio and manage it, you will utilize [Vapid](https://vapid.com), a straightforward and easy-to-use content management system. Additionally, you will get to know [Git](https://git-scm.com), a version control system that can improve your workflow massively.

### Do I need specific skills in advance?

No, the workshop is designed for students who never heard of HTML and CSS before.

### Do I need to prepare something?

To make full use of the four/five workshop days without wasting time to set everything up, we kindly ask you to follow these instructions for setting up your working environment beforehand. If that does not work as expected, we can still help you at the beginning of the workshop.
